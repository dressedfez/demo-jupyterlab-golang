# Golang demo using Jupyterlab

This repository provides a talk/demo including Jupyter notebooks (Jupyterlab) and Golang. The talk introduces into the following projects:
 * [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) 
 * [Golang](https://golang.org)
 * [Gophernotes](https://github.com/gopherdata/gophernotes) (Jupyter kernel for Golang)

 The main focus of the talk is a beginners introduction to Golang. Using the interactive nature of the Jupyter notebooks the approach is especially suitable for educational purposes.

 The project can be opened on Binder using:

**Note:**

The notebooks are often use RISE (**R**eveal.js - Jupyter/**I**Python **S**lideshow **E**xtension) in order to have a combination of a nice slide deck and the interactive nature of Jupyter/IPython notebooks.

The documentation for RISE can be found here: https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html.
