# demo-jupyterlab-golang

This repository provides a talk/demo including Jupyter notebooks (Jupyterlab) and Golang. The talk introduces into the following projects:
 * [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) 
 * [Golang](https://golang.org)
 * [Gophernotes](https://github.com/gopherdata/gophernotes) (Jupyter kernel for Golang)

 The main focus of the talk is a beginners introduction to Golang. Using the interactive nature of the Jupyter notebooks the approach is especially suitable for educational purposes.
